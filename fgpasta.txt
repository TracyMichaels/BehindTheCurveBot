To be fair, you have to have a very low IQ to understand Family Guy. The humor is extremely base, and without a solid grasp on toilet humor, most of the jokes will go under a typical viewer's taint. There's also Peter's moronic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from pre-school literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual obliviousness to truly appreciate the shallowness of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something dumb about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Family Guy truly ARE well-adjusted human beings - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Peter's mind-numbing catchphrase "c'mon Lois!" which itself is a cryptic reference to some dumb bro movie probably. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those hoity toity normies scratching their heads in confusion as Seth McFarland's idiocy unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚ And yes by the way, I DO have a Family Guy tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably higher) beforehand.
